mages are read in grayscale and resized to 64×64.

A Gaussian notch filter is applied in the frequency domain.

A 2D discrete wavelet transform (DWT, 'haar') is used to get LL, LH, HL, HH components.

These components are flattened and combined into a single feature map, then reshaped to (N, 1, 64, 64) for CNN input.

Update dataset_dir in the preprocessing scripts if your dataset is in a different location.
