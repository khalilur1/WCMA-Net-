Enhancing Mammographic Cancer Diagnosis Using Wavelet-Driven Channel-Spatial Mamba Attention: We present WCMANet (Wavelet-based Channel-wise Mamba Attention), a novel and interpretable deep learning framework that integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), channel and spatial attention, and a SS Mamba attention mechanism to improve MCC detection.
